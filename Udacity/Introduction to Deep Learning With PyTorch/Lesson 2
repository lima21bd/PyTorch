# Perceptrons

> A Perceptron is an algorithm used for supervised learning of binary classifiers. 
  Binary classifiers decide whether an input usually represented by a series of vectors belongs to a specific class.
  In short, a perceptron is a single-layer neural network. 
  They consist of four main parts including input values, weights and bias, net sum, and an activation function.
